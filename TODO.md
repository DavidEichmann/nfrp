# TODO

* Naive NFRP: broadcast all source events
  * Assume a single source event for all nodes. And create a function that
    generates all source events connected: my source event and also all other
    nodes' source events connected via TCP.
  * No clock sync (just have a placeholder)
  * Create a test "Game" from circles

# Future work

* Vector clocks (and no clock synchronization)
